  # TODO: These are the only files using LibStorage::initDefaultLogger which is
  #       an overloaded function. pluglib-bindings (the YCP addition over SWIG)
  #       don't handle the overloading, letting YCP see only one variant at
  #       random. If there are real uses of overloaded functions, this should
  #       be fixed either upstream or in our stubs.
